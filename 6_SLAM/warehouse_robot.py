# -------------------
# Background Information
#
# In this problem, you will build a planner that helps a robot
# find the shortest way in a warehouse filled with boxes
# that he has to pick up and deliver to a drop zone.
# 
# For example:
#
# warehouse = [[ 1, 2, 3],
#              [ 0, 0, 0],
#              [ 0, 0, 0]]
# dropzone = [2,0] 
# todo = [2, 1]
# 
# The robot starts at the dropzone.
# The dropzone can be in any free corner of the warehouse map.
# todo is a list of boxes to be picked up and delivered to the dropzone.
#
# Robot can move diagonally, but the cost of a diagonal move is 1.5.
# The cost of moving one step horizontally or vertically is 1.
# So if the dropzone is at [2, 0], the cost to deliver box number 2
# would be 5.

# To pick up a box, the robot has to move into the same cell as the box.
# When the robot picks up a box, that cell becomes passable (marked 0)
# The robot can pick up only one box at a time and once picked up 
# it has to return the box to the dropzone by moving onto the dropzone cell.
# Once the robot has stepped on the dropzone, the box is taken away, 
# and it is free to continue with its todo list.
# Tasks must be executed in the order that they are given in the todo list.
# You may assume that in all warehouse maps, all boxes are
# reachable from beginning (the robot is not boxed in).

# -------------------
# User Instructions
#
# Design a planner (any kind you like, so long as it works!)
# in a function named plan() that takes as input three parameters: 
# warehouse, dropzone, and todo. See parameter info below.
#
# Your function should RETURN the final, accumulated cost to do
# all tasks in the todo list in the given order, which should
# match with our answer. You may include print statements to show 
# the optimum path, but that will have no effect on grading.
#
# Your solution must work for a variety of warehouse layouts and
# any length of todo list.
# 
# Add your code at line 76.
# 
# --------------------
# Parameter Info
#
# warehouse - a grid of values, where 0 means that the cell is passable,
# and a number 1 <= n <= 99 means that box n is located at that cell.
# dropzone - determines the robot's start location and the place to return boxes 
# todo - list of tasks, containing box numbers that have to be picked up
#
# --------------------
# Testing
#
# You may use our test function below, solution_check(),
# to test your code for a variety of input parameters.
